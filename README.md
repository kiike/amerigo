Amerigo
=======

Amerigo is a [FLOSS] companion webapp for X-Plane. Its purpose is building a
moving map composed, viewable, and modifieable with, entirely, FLOSS software.
This is an alternative to [Xplage] because there might be people who won't want
to use Google Earth just to track our flights.

2. Install the requirements with pip.


Running the webapp
------------------

3. Run `amerigo.py`

4. Keeping `amerigo.py` running, execute a `python -m http.server 8080`

5. Open http://localhost:8080 with your web browser.
